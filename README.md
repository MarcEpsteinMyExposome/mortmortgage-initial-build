# MortMortgage Demo

> ### This is Act 1 of a three-act story
> In February 2026 this mortgage-origination app was built by one developer with Claude Code — 24 tasks and 377 passing tests as recorded at the time, over 8 working days across about two weeks. It was fast, and it worked. It also wasn't *delivered*: no contract, no adversarial review, no independent quality gate.
>
> That gap is what started [BrightMeld](https://brightmeld.com)'s contract-governed pipeline — first commit 19 days after this build began — which later rebuilt this same application from a single RFP: **[brightmeld-org/mortmortgage-rebuilt](https://github.com/brightmeld-org/mortmortgage-rebuilt)**. This repo is preserved as the "before" picture.

Demo web-first mortgage application (MVP) for industry demonstration.

## Overview
- Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS v3
- Backend: Next API routes + Prisma (SQLite) for local dev
- Standards: URLA 2020 data model + MISMO v3.x exports
- Mocked integrations: credit, income verification, AVM/pricing
- Auth: NextAuth.js with role-based access (Borrower, Caseworker, Admin, Supervisor)
- Docs: local file uploads with validation
- Tests: Jest + React Testing Library (351 unit tests)

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Initialize database
npx prisma db push

# 3. Seed demo data (base fixtures + caseworker data)
npm run dev:seed
npm run dev:seed-caseworkers

# 4. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 5. Run tests
npm test
```
App runs at http://localhost:3000 (or next available port)

## Project Status
| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Core Features | 20 tasks complete |
| Unit Tests | 351 tests passing |
| E2E Tests | TBD - Future |

## Documentation
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code entry point (read this first) |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Setup guide and coding standards |
| `FEATURES.md` | Product overview (non-technical) |
| `DEPLOYMENT.md` | Production deployment guide |
| `TASKS.md` | Task list with status and restart guide |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Detailed task specifications |
| `SESSION.md` | Session notes for continuity |

## CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Tests run automatically on push/PR (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Deployment**: See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for production setup

## Working with Claude Code
This project is developed with Claude Code. To resume work:
1. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
2. Claude will automatically read `CLAUDE.md` on startup
3. Or say: "Read TASKS.md and SESSION.md for full context"

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS v3.4.19
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (dev), JSON fields as strings
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js with JWT sessions
- **Validation**: Ajv (JSON Schema), custom form validators
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **PDF**: pdfmake

## Key Constraints
- Prisma pinned to v5.22.0 (v7+ has breaking changes)
- Tailwind CSS pinned to v3.4.19 (v4 has breaking changes)
- `postcss.config.js` is required for Tailwind
- SQLite stores JSON as strings (API handles serialization)
- Sign-in/out redirects use `window.location.origin` for port flexibility
