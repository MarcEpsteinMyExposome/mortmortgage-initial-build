## Latest Session Work (2026-02-16)

### Vercel Deployment & Seed Data Enrichment

**Status**: In progress — Vercel build pending confirmation

#### What Was Done:
1. **Pinned Next.js version** — Changed `"next": "*"` to `"next": "^16.1.6"` (also pinned react/react-dom to ^18.3.1). Vercel was resolving `*` to ancient Next.js 7, causing "legacy mode" build failures.
2. **Created Turso database** — Set up remote SQLite-compatible DB via Turso web GUI. Created 4 tables (User, Application, Assignment, Document) via SQL editor.
3. **Added `userId` column to Turso** — PR merge (ROLES-01) added `userId`/`CreatedBy` relation to Application model. Need to run `ALTER TABLE "Application" ADD COLUMN "userId" TEXT;` in Turso SQL editor.
4. **Enriched seed data** — Rewrote `seed-demo.ts` to use `fake-data.ts` helpers for full URLA coverage:
   - Co-borrowers (25% of applications, 60% share last name as spouse)
   - Demographics (race, ethnicity, sex — HMDA fields)
   - Military service (correlated with VA loan type)
   - Previous addresses (when current residence < 2 years)
   - Previous employment (when current job started recently)
   - Additional income sources (~20% — rental, pension, alimony, etc.)
   - Gift funds (~15% of purchase loans)
   - Richer assets (2-4 varied types), liabilities (1-4 varied types)
   - Real estate owned (more likely for refinance borrowers)
   - Declarations with realistic random distribution
5. **Merged ROLES-01 PR** — Consolidated from 4 roles to 3 (removed ADMIN). Borrower scoping, caseworker claim workflow, 26 new tests.
6. **Updated local DB** — Ran `prisma generate` and `prisma db push` for new schema.

#### Pending:
- **Turso**: Run `ALTER TABLE "Application" ADD COLUMN "userId" TEXT REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;` in Turso SQL editor
- **Vercel**: Confirm build succeeds with pinned Next.js 16 + all env vars set
- **Vercel**: After successful deploy, hit "Seed Demo Data" button from supervisor dashboard
- **Vercel env vars needed**: `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db`

#### Files Modified This Session:
- `package.json` — Pinned next, react, react-dom versions
- `src/pages/api/admin/seed-demo.ts` — Enriched seed data with fake-data helpers
- Plus 27 files from ROLES-01 PR merge

## Previous Session Work (2026-02-15)

### ROLES-01: Consolidate Roles (Remove ADMIN, Three-Role System)
**Branch**: `feature/consolidate-roles`
**Status**: DONE

Consolidated from 4 roles (BORROWER, ADMIN, CASEWORKER, SUPERVISOR) to 3 clean roles:
- **BORROWER**: Create apps, view only their own
- **CASEWORKER**: See assigned + unassigned queues, claim & process apps
- **SUPERVISOR**: Full portal with stats, assign/auto-assign, analytics, manage caseworkers

**Changes Made:**
- **Schema**: Added `userId` to Application model for borrower ownership tracking
- **Auth**: Removed ADMIN from `UserRole` type and role hierarchy; JWT fallback maps legacy ADMIN→SUPERVISOR
- **Demo Users**: Removed `admin@demo.com` account
- **API Routes (11 files)**: Updated all `isRole(user, 'ADMIN', 'SUPERVISOR')` → `isRole(user, 'SUPERVISOR')`; added borrower scoping (`where.userId`) and ownership checks; caseworkers can self-assign (claim) unassigned apps
- **Pages**: Merged supervisor dashboard into admin page; removed `/supervisor` page; renamed "Admin Portal" → "Supervisor Portal"; added unassigned work queue with Claim button to caseworker page; updated sign-in page (removed admin button); updated confirmation page link
- **Tests**: Added 26 new tests (role-access + borrower-scoping); all 377 tests pass
- **Docs**: Updated CLAUDE.md, SESSION.md

**Files Modified**: 23 | **Files Deleted**: 1 (supervisor/index.tsx) | **Files Created**: 2 (tests)

## Previous Session Work (2026-02-08)

### ENV-FIX: Windows ARM64 Compatibility & Environment Setup
**Branch**: `fix/env-setup-and-arm64-compat`
**Status**: DONE — build and tests passing, ready to merge

**Problem**: Project wouldn't run on Windows ARM64 (Node.js v24 arm64). Multiple issues:
1. Prisma v7 installed despite `^5.22.0` pin (caret allowed major upgrade)
2. `canvas` npm package had no ARM64 prebuilt binaries
3. Next.js SWC native module not valid on ARM64
4. Prisma query engine `.dll.node` couldn't load in ARM64 Node.js
5. Turbopack WASM bindings don't support `createProject` on ARM64
6. Seed script passed raw objects to SQLite (requires JSON strings)

**Fixes Applied** (3 commits):
1. **`2fd8710`** — Pin Prisma to exact `5.22.0`, replace `canvas` with `jest-canvas-mock`, fix seed script `JSON.stringify()`, pin Jest deps, add `--webpack` to dev script
2. **`eb5f8aa`** — Add `engineType = "binary"` to Prisma schema (runs query engine as x64 `.exe` under emulation), add `jest-canvas-mock` import in setupTests
3. **`0b8b900`** — Add `--webpack` to build script (Turbopack WASM unsupported), exclude `scripts/` and `prisma/` from tsconfig (avoids missing module errors from standalone scripts)

**Verification**:
- `npx prisma generate` — succeeds (engine=binary)
- `npm run build` — compiles successfully with webpack, all 38 routes generated
- `npm test` — 14 suites, 316 tests passing

**Also done**: Updated `.claude/settings.local.json` to reduce permission prompts while keeping safety guards (deny `rm`, `force push`, `hard reset`).

## Previous Session Work (2026-02-05)

### ARCH-01: Layered Architecture Plan Created
- Full 5-phase plan for refactoring to layered architecture (DB → Repository → Service → API → UI Hooks)
- Plan file: `docs/ARCH-01-layered-architecture.md`
- 21 new files, ~48 modified files across 5 phases
- Status: PLANNED — awaiting decision on when/whether to implement

### CI/Test Fixes
- **Jest config**: Added `testMatch` to only run `src/**/*.test.ts` (excludes Cypress specs)
- **CI workflow**: Skip OCR integration tests (Tesseract requires canvas libs unavailable in CI)
- **Git security**: Added `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (was accidentally committed)

### Bug Fix: OCR Extraction Results Displaying Character-by-Character

**Problem**: Document OCR extraction showed 612 individual characters as separate fields (e.g., `{`, `"`, `d`, `o`, `c`...) instead of properly parsed field names and values.

**Root Cause**: The `/api/apps/[id]/documents` GET endpoint returned JSON string fields (`extractedData`, `extractedFields`, `fieldConfidences`) directly from SQLite without parsing them. When the UI's `Object.entries()` received a string instead of an object, it iterated character by character.

**Fix**: Added JSON.parse() for the three JSON string fields in the documents listing API before returning to the client.

**File Modified**: `src/pages/api/apps/[id]/documents/index.ts` (lines 44-75)

**Related**: This bug was in INTEG-04 (AI Document Intelligence) which was already marked DONE. The extraction endpoint (`/api/documents/[docId]/extraction.ts`) already had the JSON parsing logic - the documents listing endpoint was missing it.

### UX-02: Wizard Stepper Fix + UX Polish Bundle

**Bug Fix: Wizard stepper steps not visible**
- Problem: Steps 8-12 (Property, Loan, Declarations, Demographics, Documents) were hidden off-screen with a nearly invisible scrollbar
- Solution: Added scroll arrow buttons + auto-scroll to active step
- File: `src/components/ApplicationWizard.tsx`

**UX Improvements:**
1. **Auto-save timestamp** - Shows "Saved at X:XX PM" after successful save (`ApplicationWizard.tsx`)
2. **"In Review" status** - Added to admin dashboard stat cards and filter (`admin/index.tsx`)
3. **Plaid success toast** - Shows "Successfully connected to [Bank Name]" after bank connection (`PlaidLink.tsx`)

**Documentation:**
- Added Claude Code CLI installation and plugin documentation to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Recommended plugins: `typescript-lsp`, `github`, `frontend-design`, `commit-commands`

**Tests:** 217 tests passing

## Mock Integration Demo Patterns

### Credit Pull (SSN-based)
- Ending in 0-2: Poor credit (500-649)
- Ending in 3-4: Fair credit (650-699)
- Ending in 5-6: Good credit (700-749)
- Ending in 7-9: Excellent credit (750-850)

### Income Verification (SSN-based)
- Even SSN: Clean verification
- Odd, ends in 1/3: Minor discrepancy
- Odd, ends in 5/7/9: Unable to verify

### Property Valuation (State-based)
- CA, NY, WA: High price markets ($400-550/sqft)
- TX, OH, PA: Lower price markets ($150-200/sqft)

### Pricing Engine
- Base rates by loan type (Conventional: 6.75%, FHA: 6.50%)
- Adjustments for credit, LTV, property type, occupancy
